I am a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology, [Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences](http://www.gps.caltech.edu). I am interested in ocean dynamics, ice-ocean interactions, sea ice variability, and high-latitude climate change. 

For my PhD thesis, I studied ice-ocean interactions around Antarctica, focusing on the wintertime coupling between deep ocean ventilation and sea ice growth. This work relied heavily on under-ice ocean data collected by Argo floats and instrumented seals.

For my postdoctoral research, I am working with [Professor Andy Thompson](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/index.html) to tackle the general topic of deep ocean heat transport across the polar gyres of the Southern Ocean.
