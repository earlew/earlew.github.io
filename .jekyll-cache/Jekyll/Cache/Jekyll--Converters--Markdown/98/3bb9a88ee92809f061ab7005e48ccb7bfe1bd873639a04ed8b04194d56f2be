I"<p>I am a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology, <a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu">Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences</a>. I am interested in ocean dynamics, ice-ocean interactions, sea ice variability, and high-latitude climate change.</p>

<p>For my PhD thesis, I studied ice-ocean interactions around Antarctica, focusing on the wintertime coupling between deep ocean ventilation and sea ice growth. This work relied heavily on under-ice ocean data collected by Argo floats and instrumented seals.</p>

<p>For my postdoctoral research, I am working with <a href="http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/index.html">Professor Andy Thompson</a> to tackle the general topic of deep ocean heat transport across the polar gyres of the Southern Ocean.</p>
